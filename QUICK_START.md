## 🤔 FAQs

**Q: Do I need to be technical to do Phase 0?**  
A: No! Phase 0 is validation (interviews, landing page). We'll build the landing page together. The technical work starts in Phase 1.

**Q: What if tryava.com is taken?**  
A: Try ava.app, getava.com, or meetava.com. The product name matters more than the domain.

**Q: Should I quit my job to work on this?**  
A: NO! Start part-time (10-20 hrs/week). Only consider full-time after validation + revenue.

**Q: What if I don't get 100 signups?**  
A: Iterate messaging, try different audiences, or reconsider the idea. Validation saves you from building something nobody wants.

**Q: Can I skip Phase 0 and just build?**  
A: Not recommended. 2 weeks of validation saves months of building the wrong thing. Trust the process.

**Q: How much coding do I need to know?**  
A: For Phase 0: None. For Phase 1: Basic web development (we'll guide you) OR hire a developer.
